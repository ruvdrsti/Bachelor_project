\section{Introduction}

\paragraph*{}
When thinking about chemistry, one always thinks in terms of atoms, that are bonded together in molecules. In order to correctly predict the behaviour of 
thes entities we will need to know what they look like. How are the atoms aranged in a molecule? Why are they arranged in this way? The answer to these
questions lies in the Shrödinger equation, \eqref{eq:erwin}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:erwin}
  \hat{H}\Psi = E\Psi
\end{equation} 
The Shrödinger equation allows us to express the energy of a wave function. However, it is not exactly solvable for systems that contain one or more electrons,
i.e. all relevant systems. The reason for this is the repulsion that exists between two electrons. This term makes it impossible to solve the Shrödinger equation
analytically for most systems. That is why we need to make approximations. In this paper we will make use of the Hartree-Fock method, which accounts for this
interaction by means of a coulomb operator, \eqref{eq:coulomb}, which accounts for the electronic repulsion between electrons and an exchange operator,
\eqref{eq:exchange}, which accounts for stabilisation between electrons with the same spin. 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:coulomb}
  \hat{J}_j\psi_i(1) = \int\psi_j(2)^*\boldsymbol{r}_{12}^{-1}\psi_j(2)d2 \psi_i(1)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:exchange}
  \hat{K}_j\psi_i(1) = \int\psi_j(2)^*\boldsymbol{r}_{12}^{-1}\psi_i(2)d2 \psi_j(1)
\end{equation}
We can define an expectation value over the Hamiltonian and state that if we are in an energy minimum a small variation in the wave function will not induce a change
in energy \eqref{eq:hamexp}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hamexp}
  \langle\psi + \delta\psi|\hat{H}|\psi + \delta\psi \rangle = E + \delta E + \delta E^* + \delta E^2
\end{equation}
In first order we say that if $\psi$ is an eigenfunction of $\hat{H}$, $\delta E$ will equal zero. We will not go into any further detail here.
This approximation might take us a long way in the right direction, but does it take us all the way there? Here we need to introduce different methods within the
Hartree-Fock theory. Restricted Closed shell Hartree-Fock (RHF) forces the electrons into the same orbitals, thus creating doubly occupied orbitals. Even though this 
picture is a chemically logical one, since in chemistry we think about electrons in pairs, physically there is no obligation for the electrons to exist in these pairs.
When we let go of the restriction, we enter the Unrestricted Hartree-Fock method (UHF). This  is no longer confined to closed shell species since it has no problem with 
electrons that do not exist in pairs. However, we see that the wave function in this method does not contain the right symmetries. It paints a physical picture, yet the
chemical intuition is tossed out of the window. This phenomenon is called spin-contamination.
\paragraph*{}
In this particular paper we will take a look at the symmetry in the Hamiltonian. We know that in molecules there can be a lot of symmetry. This symmetry also exists in that 
molecules Hamiltonian, and thus also in every eigenfunction. Now we can easily state that every approximation we make of these eigenfunctions must contain that same symmetry. 
If we aspire to create somthing that is close to reality, but end up with something that does not have any real symmetry, we can do better. The important relation here is that 
the Hamiltonian commutes with the $\hat{S}^2$ operator, meaning that these operators share a complete set of eigenfunctions. Thus an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian must also
be an eigenfunction of $\hat{S}^2$. We can express this using a commutator \eqref{eq:commut}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:commut}
  [\hat{H}, \hat{R}] = 0
\end{equation}
We pick the operator $\hat{R}$ as being a certain symmetry operator. Looking back at equation \eqref{eq:hamexp} and the constraint we applied, namely that $\delta E$ should 
remain zero, one can wonder whether equation \eqref{eq:commut} also still holds. Is the slightly varied wave function still an eigenfunction of the symmetry operator as well.
This leads us to Löwdins symmetry dilemma \cite{Lowdin1963}. When we enforce the symmetry and the energy constraint at the same time, the minimum energy we reach is not the
global minimum. However when we drop the symmetry constraint and only enforce the energy, we will reach a lower energy, but will lose all the information with regard to the
symmetry of the system.
\paragraph*{}
We need some kind of theory to bring the best of both worlds together. One one side, we have the chemical intution in the restricted wave functions, on the other the physical
truth in the unrestricted wave functions. Roothaans Restricted Open Shell theory (ROHF)\cite{Roothaan1960} was an early attempt. However, more recently Tsuchimochi and Scuseria
presented their Constrained Unrestricted Hartree Fock theory (CUHF)\cite{Scuseria2010}. A lot has been said already about this method\cite{Plakhutin2014, Scuseria2011}. In CUHF we
se the spin-contamination to zero. In this work we will use the CUHF wave function as a reference for Single excitation Configuration Interaction (CIS). We will generate the single
excitation energies for the CUHF wave function and compare them to the ROHF and UHF excitations of the same system. 

\paragraph*{}
In this paper we will begin by explaining the theory needed to understand the aformentioned concepts. We will then demonstrate the impact of spin-contamination using the hydrogen gas
dicossiation problem in the different Hartree-Fock modes. After that we will compare the CIS results for UHF, CUHF and ROHF. From there we will be able to verify whether it makes
sense to use CUHF as a reference next to ROHF and UHF. 


\section{Theory}

\subsection{Spin-Contamination}
In general one can define the expectation value of $\hat{S}^2$ like equation \eqref{eq:spinexp}\cite{Andrews1991}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:spinexp}
    \langle S^2 \rangle = S_z^2 + S_z + q - \sum_{ij}^{pq} S_{ij}^2
\end{equation}
This equation holds for all systems with $q$ beta electrons and $p$ alpha electrons. When the overlap is diagonal, the last terms vanish and we are left with $S_z(S_z + 1)$. 
Spin-contamination is then defined as Equation \eqref{eq:spincont}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:spincont}
    \delta_s = \langle S^2 \rangle - S_z(S_z + 1)
\end{equation}
As a consequence, UHF suffers a lot from spin contamination. When the alpha and beta orbitals are not the same, the overlap matrix $S$ will not be diagonal. One can not expect the 
last two terms in equation \eqref{eq:spinexp} to vanish, which will result in $\delta_s$ not being equal to zero. This also means that the wave function is no longer an eigenfunction 
of $\hat{S^2}$, as we have seen before. We lose a quantum number and with it the symmetry of the system. We can rewrite spin-contamination as Equation \eqref{eq:spincont2}\cite{Savin2010}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:spincont2}
    \delta_s = N_\beta - Tr(\gamma^\alpha\gamma^\beta)
\end{equation}
In this equation, $\gamma^{\alpha}$ and $\gamma^\beta$ are the one particle density matrices. In the NO basis, these matrices are block diagonal \cite{Scuseria2010}, with blocks that
can be seen in equations \eqref{eq:gammaa} and \eqref{eq:gammab}, where i corresponds to a certain closed shell orbital. The $\gamma^\alpha$ also contains a block that is a 
unity matrix with dimensions $n\times n$ where n is the amount of singly occupied orbitals. In $\gamma^\beta$ this block is a zero matrix of the same dimensions.
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
  \label{eq:gammaa}
  \gamma^\alpha_i &= \begin{bmatrix}
    n_i & m_i \\
    m_i & 1- n_i
  \end{bmatrix}&& \\
  \label{eq:gammab}
  \gamma^\beta_i &= \begin{bmatrix}
    n_i & -m_i \\
    -m_i & 1-n_i
  \end{bmatrix}&&
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
 In these equations $n_i$ is the occupation of orbital i and $m_i = \sqrt{n_i - n_i^2}$\cite{Scuseria2010} We can the define the spin density matrix $M = (\gamma^\alpha - \gamma^\beta)/2$. It is obvious then that equation \eqref{eq:mmatrix} then holds.
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:mmatrix}
   M_i = \begin{bmatrix}
     0 & m_i \\
     m_i & 0
   \end{bmatrix}
 \end{equation}
Using this information we can rewrite equation \eqref{eq:spincont2} to equation \eqref{eq:spincont3}\cite{Scuseria2010}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:spincont3}
  \delta_s = N_\beta - (N_\alpha + N_\beta)/2 + 2*Tr(M^2)
\end{equation}
In an additional step, we can use algebra to find equation \eqref{eq:spincontfinal}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:spincontfinal}
  \delta_s = 4\sum^{N_{cp}}_i m_i^2
\end{equation}
Now if we want to make the spin contamination zero, we have to eneforce double occupation or no occupation at all. The $N_{cp}$ are the closed shell orbitals. We see here that in 
the closed shell itself, we can no longer have a difference between alpha and beta orbitals. This will be the constraint that gives us the CUHF method.

\subsection{Constrained Unrestricted Hartree Fock}
When talking about CUHF, there is more then one way to make sure that the spin-contamination remains zero. Scuseria and Tsuchimochi will enforce the constraint we mentioned in the 
last section, where they allow only doubly occupied orbitals in the closed shell\cite{Scuseria2010}. It can be shown that the normal UHF energy can be constructed by adding a 
correlation energy term to the closed shell energy. These terms can be seen in equations \eqref{eq:cseng} and \eqref{eq:correng}\cite{Savin2010}.
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:cseng}
    E_{cs} &= 2\sum_{ij}h_{ij}P_{ij} + \sum_{ijkl}(2\langle ij|kl\rangle - \langle ij|lk \rangle)P_{ik}P_{jl}&&\\
    \label{eq:correng}
    E_c &= -\sum_{ijkl}\langle ij|lk \rangle M_{ik}M_{jl}&&
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
Where the matrix $M$ is the spin density matrix (cfr. supra) and the $P$ matrix is the charge density matrix: $P = (\gamma^\alpha + \gamma^\beta)/2$. If we take the 
derivative with respect to the density matrices we find equations \eqref{eq:der1} and \eqref{eq:der2}.
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:der1}
    &&\frac{\partial E_{cs}}{\partial \gamma^\alpha_{ij}} &= \frac{\partial E_{cs}}{\partial \gamma^\beta_{ij}} = F^{cs}_{ij} \\
    \label{eq:der2}
    &&-\frac{\partial E_c}{\partial \gamma^\alpha_{ij}} &= \frac{\partial E_c}{\partial \gamma^\beta_{ij}} = \sum_{kl} \langle ik|lj \rangle M_{kl} = \Delta^{UHF}_{ij}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
So in fact, the UHF Fock operators can be written as a sum of this $\Delta^{UHF}$ and the closed shell Fock operator. Now we need to expand this concept to CUHF. In general, we want
to be able to write the CUHF Fock matrix $\tilde{F}$ as the closed shell Fock matrix to which we add a certain $\Delta^{CUHF}$. As we have already seen, the constraint is only 
applied to the virtual and closed shell orbitals. When we display the Fock matrix in MO basis it will exist in blocks, \eqref{eq:fockblock}. The \textit{c}, \textit{o} and \textit{v} 
stand for closed shell, open shell and virtual respectively.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fockblock}
  F = \begin{bmatrix}
    F_{cc} & F_{co} & F_{cv} \\
    F_{oc} & F_{oo} & F_{ov} \\
    F_{vc} & F_{vo} & F_{vv} \\
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
We apply the contraint in the \textit{vc} and \textit{cv} blocks. We can do this by stating that $[\tilde{F}^\sigma, \gamma^\sigma] = 0$, where $\sigma$ can equal either $\alpha$ 
or $\beta$. This basically means that the density matrices should share a complete set of eigenfunctions with the Fock matrices. This, in turn, means that the Fock matrices should be 
diagonal at self consistent field (SCF) conditions in the NO basis. By subtracting the two conditions and algebraically working out the result we find that at SCF conditions 
$\Delta^{CUHF}_{cv}$ has to be equal to zero. This means that $\tilde{F}_{cv} = F_{cv}^{cs}$\cite{Scuseria2010}. For every other block, the CUHF Fock matrix equals the UHF Fock matrix,
so the $\Delta^{CUHF}$ equals the $\Delta^{UHF}$. When we enforce this contraint during every iteration, we will decrease the spin contamination. This does entail that we will need 
to transform the $\Delta^{UHF}$ to NO basis every time to enforce this constraint. This transformation will consist of two steps. First we need to transform the density matrix to 
an orthonormal basis, since AO basis is often not orthonormal. (Indeed, if it were, we would not expect any bonds to form.) We choose MO basis. The MO's are defined by the 
eigenvectors of the Fock operator, we will use the closed shell Fock operator. Given the Roothaan equation \eqref{eq:roothaan}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:roothaan}
  F_{cs}C = \epsilon S C
\end{equation}
With a simple transformation, we can see that the Fock operator will become diagonal using the transformation in equation \eqref{eq:fmo}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fmo}
  C^T F C = \epsilon C^T S C
\end{equation}
This is true, since $C^T S C$ it the unity matrix if the C matrix holds the eigenvectors of the generalised eigen value problem. To transform to NO basis, we will also need the
density matrix in the MO basis. This is not trivial, since the density matrix is ussualy defined by the coeficcient matrices C. To transform the density matrix $P$, we will need
to do a slightly different transformation. This transformation is given in equation \eqref{eq:dtrans}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dtrans}
  P^{MO} = C^{-1}P^{AO}(C^{-1})^T 
\end{equation}
We can then calculate the eigenvalues and subject the $\Delta^{UHF}$ to these transformations \eqref{eq:fulltrans}, we have easy acces to the \textit{cv} and \textit{vc} blocks. 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fulltrans}
  \Delta_{NO}^{UHF} = V^{-1} C^T \Delta^{UHF}_AO C V^{-1}
\end{equation}
The $V$ matrix containts the coefficients of the eigenvectors of the $P$ matrix. Now we just switch the required blocks to zero, backtranform and add the now $\Delta$ to the closed 
shell Fock matrix. 

\subsection{Configuration interaction}

The Hartree Fock approximation gives us an initial guess for the energy and the wavefunction. However, it can be improved upon. These methods are called post Hartree-Fock methods. 
The difference in energy between the two methods is called the correlation energy \eqref{eq:Ecorr}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Ecorr}
    E_{corr} = \mathcal{E}_0 - E_0
\end{equation}
Here $E_0$ is the Hartee-Fock energy and $\mathcal{E}_0$ it the post Hartree-Fock energy. There are various approaches to post Hatree-Fock methods. We will be looking a little closer
at configuration interaction. The concept is fairly straightforward. If $\Psi_0$ is a good approximation of the wave function $\Phi_0$, we know that we can make a better approximation
using a linear combination of excited states \eqref{eq:lincomb}\cite{Szabo1996}. If all these states are called configurations, they will interact, hence the name configuration 
interaction, or CI for short.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lincomb}
    |\Psi_0\rangle = c_0|\Psi_0\rangle + \sum_{ar}|\Psi_a^r\rangle + \sum_{a<b,r<s}c_{ab}^{rs}|\Psi^{rs}_{ab} \rangle + \cdots
\end{equation}
With regard to this new wave function $\Phi_0$ we can observe some interesting phenomena. When we try to get the energy expectation value of this function, we can write it in matrix
form, where each row and collumn correspond to a certain excited state. When we look at single excitations, so at stats $\Psi_r^a$ where the electron from orbital $r$ has been
excited to orbital $a$, we can write equation \eqref{eq:overlapsingle}\cite{Szabo1996}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:overlapsingle}
  \langle\Psi_0 |\hat{H}|\Psi_r^a\rangle = \langle a|h|r \rangle + \sum_b \langle ab||rb \rangle = \langle \chi_a |\hat{f}| \chi_r \rangle
\end{equation}
Here $\langle ab||rb \rangle$ is shorthand notation for $\langle ab | rb \rangle - \langle ab | br \rangle$. The letter a here represents the orbital $\chi_a$ 
Now of course, by definition, at SCF conditions the off diagonal elements of the Fock matrix are zero. This is known as Brillouin's theorem. It states that there is no overlap 
between single excited states and the ground state wave functions when taking the expectation value over the Hamiltonian. This makes sense, because if there was, the ground state 
would not be the most stable in the first place. What this means is that when only looking at single excitations, we do not expect to see the energy lowered. And indeed, one can 
prove equation \eqref{eq:doubles}. The correlation energy is only defined by the overlap between second order excited states.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:doubles}
    E_{corr} = \sum_{i<j, r<s} C_{ij}^{rs}\langle \Psi_{0} |\hat{H}|\Psi_{ij}^{rs}\rangle
\end{equation}
In CIS we are only interested in the first order excitations. This might seem odd, since we do not excpect a more stable wave function. However, it can give us information about the 
excited states and the excitation energies that come with them. Now we are interested in the expectation values over the Hamiltonian of all the exited states, so we need an expression
for $\langle \Psi_r^a |\hat{H}| \Psi_s^b \rangle$. There are four different situations that we need to discuss here\cite{Sherrill1996}. The first scenario is an excitation where 
$a \neq b$ and $r \neq s$. The only term that will remain in that case is $\langle aj || ib \rangle$. Another case is when $r = s$ but $a \neq b$. Then the matrix element can be 
expressed using equation \eqref{eq:exp1}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:exp1}
  \langle \Psi_r^a|\hat{H}|\Psi^b_r \rangle = h_{ab} + \sum_{k\in r} \langle ak || bk \rangle = F_{ab} - \langle ar||br \rangle
\end{equation}

Another case, where $r \neq s$ and $a = b$ we can write equation \eqref{eq:exp2}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:exp2}
  \langle \Psi_r^a|\hat{H}|\Psi^a_s \rangle = -h_{rs} - \sum_{k \in \{\Psi_0 + a\}} \langle ak || bk \rangle = -F_{rs} - \langle ra || sa \rangle
\end{equation}
Finally when both $a = b$ and $r = s$ we can find \eqref{eq:exp3}
\begin{multline}\label{eq:exp3}
  \langle \Psi^a_r|\hat{H}|\Psi^a_r \rangle = \sum_{k \in \Psi_0}h_{kk} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{k,l \in \Psi_0} \langle kl||kl \rangle - h_{rr} + h_{aa} \\ - \sum_{k \in \Psi_0} \langle
  kr || kr \rangle + \sum_{k \in \Psi_0} \langle ka||ka \rangle - \langle ra||ra \rangle 
\end{multline}
We can pull all these equations into one general equation \eqref{eq:matrixelement}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:matrixelement}
  \langle \Psi_r^a|\hat{H}|\Psi_s^b \rangle = E_0\delta_{rs}\delta_{ab} + F_{ab}\delta_{rs} - F_{rs}\delta_{ab} + \langle as || jb \rangle
\end{equation}
We notice that $E_0$ is added along the diagonal. Since we know that the trace of a matrix is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues, we can subtract $E_0$ from the diagonal and just 
add it to every eigenvalue at the end. At self consistent field conditions the Fock operator equals $F_{ij} = \epsilon_i\delta_{ij}$, so Equation \eqref{eq:matrixelement} can be 
simplified to equation \eqref{eq:simple}. 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:simple}
  \langle \Psi_r^a|\hat{H}|\Psi_s^b \rangle = (\epsilon_a - \epsilon_r)\delta_{rs}\delta_{ab} + \langle as || jb \rangle
\end{equation}
The $\epsilon$ values correspond to the orbital energies. If we now diagonilize this matrix we end up with the excitation energies and contributions of the single excited states as 
eigenfunctions. However, since electrons in alpha orbitals can be excited to beta orbitals, which is especcially important in UHF, we have to do some extra steps, using the 
Kronecker product \eqref{eq:kron}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:kron}
    R' = I_2 \otimes (I_2 \otimes R)^T
\end{equation}
The $R'$ matrix now has double the dimensions of the original R matrix. This is necesarry for the two electron integrals, since they only contain half the orbitals. These integrals 
are in the original basis, but we need to account for all possible excitations, meaning that we have to account for alpha and beta orbitals at the same time. Since the two electron 
integrals are given in AO basis, they still need to be transformed to MO basis, since we want the Fock operators to be diagonal in Equation \eqref{eq:matrixelement}. To do this 
transformation we will need the coefficient matrix from Equation \eqref{eq:coefs}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:coefs}
    C' = \begin{bmatrix}
        C_a & 0 \\
        0 & C_b \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation} 
In this matrix $C_a$ corresponds to the coefficient matrix of the alpha orbitals and $C_b$ to the coeficient matrix of the beta orbitals. The diagonal blocks are all zero, since there 
is no contibution of the alpha orbitals to the beta orbitals and vice versa. 


\section{Methodology}

How were methods/descriptors implemented and characterized? Which systems are of interest for this hypothesis?
\paragraph*{}
The $H_3$ radical will be used as a model system. This is a small molecule that allows for easy interpretation and oversight. We will also use a limited basis, sto-3g, for these same reasons.
\section{Results and discussion}

Central ideas: What were the results? Organize the outline and the paper around easily assimilated data - tables, equations, figures, schemes - rather than around text. Organize in order of importance, not in chronological order.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The $H_2$ stretch in different HF modes.
    \item The excited states in different HF modes
    \item Spin contamination in the excited states
\end{itemize}

\subsection{$H_2$ Stretch}
We will demonstrate the effect of spin contamination using the stretch of the dihydrogen molecule.
\begin{center}
  \begin{figure}[h]
      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./../notes/figures/rhf.png}
      \caption{The RHF energy against the distance in an $H_2$ stretch. The zero level was chosen as the energy of two separate hydrogen atoms.}
      \label{fig:rhfstretch}
  \end{figure}
\end{center}
In Figure \ref{fig:rhfstretch} we can see that the RHF solution is not physically valid. Indeed, we expect the energy to evolve towards the energy of two seperate hydrogen atoms, which clearly does not happen. However we see that the spin contamination is zero, so the wave function has the correct symmetry. The reason for this is simple. We artificially trap the electrons in the same orbital.
\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./../notes/figures/uhf.png}
  \caption{The UHF energy against the distance in an $H_2$ stretch}
  \label{fig:uhfstretch}
\end{figure}
\end{center}
Figure \ref{fig:uhfstretch} shows a physically more correct result. We see that the system does evolve towards two hydrogen atoms. Howver, the spin contamination is rising, and after a certain point reaches the value one. This means that the wave function does no longer have the right symmetry, ergo it is no longer the right wave function.
\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./../notes/figures/cuhf_mix.png}
  \caption{The CUHF energy against the distance in an $H_2$ stretch}
  \label{fig:cuhfstretch}
\end{figure}
\end{center}
The CUHF picture in Figure \ref{fig:cuhfstretch} is difficult to interpret. We see that the spin contamination remains zero. The energy seems to follow the RHF pattern (see also Figure \ref{fig:combo}) untill a certain point. Then it starts to exponantially decline. Physically this seems like a logical behaviour, as it is now again eveolving to two separate hydrogen atoms. 
\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./../notes/figures/combo.png}
  \caption{The stretch energies plotted together}
  \label{fig:combo}
\end{figure}
\end{center}
For comparison we plotted all the stretches in one plot, Figure \ref{fig:combo}. Here we can see that they all describe short bond lengths correctly, but as the internuclear distance increases, there are deviations visible.
\subsection{CIS results}
We need to plot the excitation energies of $H_3$, together with the ground state energy. This will be done for UHF, CUHF and ROHF, as soon as we can verify our data.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Method implementation
    \paragraph*{}
    For the code we used python with the help of the psi4 package.
    \item Method characterization
    \item System characterization
    \item Results
\end{itemize}
\paragraph*{Figures}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Excitation energies in all modes 
    \item orbitals?
\end{itemize}
\paragraph*{Schemes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item electron configurations for different modes (learn to draw them!!)
\end{itemize}
