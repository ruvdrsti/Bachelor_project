    "In this notebook, we will be studying the effect of single excitation configuration interaction on the resuls obtained from constrained unrestricted hartree-fock. We will use the package psi4 for reference data and some basic methods. The UHF and CUHF code will come from the compChem package. We will begin this discussion with a theoretical approach to CIS and on the implementation in a normal UHF system. We will then proceed to extrapolate these findings to CUHF. The theory will be developed for RHF and then implemented for UHF, with the nessecary adjustments."

However we will need to solve the schr√∂dinger equation again, now using this new function. We will need to make a new hamiltonian, including all excited states as well as the ground state. There are a lot of possible combinations and one can imagine that it will be difficult to express let alone solve this matrix. However, we could also change our basis. When we use the ground state and the excited states as a basis, we find the following matrix (2).\n",

    "Overall the dimensions of this matrix will be the amount of occupied orbitals ($o$) times the amount of unoccupied orbitals ($u$), since for every occupied orbital $o$ there will be $u$ possible ways to create an excited state. However, note that in the represention that is being used here, $\\Psi_0$ is also an eigenfunction of the hamiltonian, so we added an extra row and an extra collumn. The elements in the added rows and collums are all zero in accordance to Brillouin's theorem, which states that if $\\Psi_0$ is a self consistent Hartree-Fock wave function, the overlap elements of the hamiltonian are zero for any single excited state. This means that the hamiltonian is block diagonal, with one very large block. Nevertheless, this is a step forward from it not being block diagonal. We can also pretty easily express these matrix elements. This can be seen in Equation (3).\n",

    "Now that we have an expression for our hamiltonian, we can solve the eigenequations for it. The only thing left to figure out is what basis this hamiltonian is given in. Since it is made up out of the ground state and the excited states, these should all be eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian itself, wo the basis used is MO basis. We could start using the eigenfunctions of the fock operator at scf conditions (which is off course needed for Brillouin's theorem to hold) and start iterating from there. So we would calculate the eigenfunctions and the energy, use these to create a new operator and repeat. Alternatively we could substract $E_0$ from it, so that we get the change in energy with respect to the orginal HF energy. An additional note we can make is that $F_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}\\epsilon_i$ at scf conditions, since the fock matrix should be diagonal there. This will simplify Equation (4) to Equation (5), in which we also substracted $E_0$.\n",
