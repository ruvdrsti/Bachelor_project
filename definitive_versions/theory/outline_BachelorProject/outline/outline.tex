\section{Introduction}

Central ideas: Why did I do the work? What were the central motivations and hypotheses?

\paragraph*{}
The Shrödinger equation allows us to express the energy of a wave function. However, since it is not exactly solvable for systems that 
have more than one electron, e.i. all most all things of importance, we are forced to make approximations. In these approximations we will
deviate from reality by applying certain constraints that will allow us to solve the system. However, doing so will decrease the amount
of freedom a system has to evolve. One might ask the question wheter we are not artifficially creating something that behaves like it is 
reality, but acctually is nothing more than a construct. However if we do not impose constraints, we lose a lot of control, meaning that 
interpretation and data collection might jeopardized. 
\paragraph*{}
In this particular paper we will take a look at the symmetry in the Hamiltonian. We know that in molecules there can be a lot of symmetry.
This symmetry also exists in that molecules Hamiltonian, and thus also in every eigenfunction. Now we can easily state that every 
approximation we make of these eigenfunctions must contain that same symmetry. If we aspire to create somthing that is close to reality,
but end up with something that does not have any real symmetry, we can do better. The important relation here is that the Hamiltonian 
commutes with the $S^2$ operator, meaning that these operators share a complete set of eigenfunctions. Thus an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian must also
be an eigenfunction of $S^2$. This operator is responsible for the symmetry in a molecule.


\begin{itemize}
    \item The objectives of the work. 
    \paragraph*{}
    We want to expand the framework of Constrained Unrestricted Hartree Fock theory by applying Single Excitation Configuration 
    Interaction to the CUHF wave function.
    \item The justification for these objectives: Why is the work important? Cite the most important works \cite{whitesides2004a}.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Possibility to use cuhf as CIS reference => expand to more excitations?
      \item Plakhutin handled ionisation, does the same apply to excitation?
      \item Symmetry is important => slides Scuseria for importance.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Background: Who else has done what? How? What have we done previously?
    \paragraph*{}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Tsuchimochi and Scuseria \textit{Communication: ROHF theory made simple}: this describes CUHF theory
      \item Plakhutin and Davidson \textit{Canonical form of the Hartree-Fock orbitals in open-shell systems}: describes what is wrong with CUHF
      \item Tsuchimochi and Scuseria \textit{Constrained active space unrestricted mean-field methods for controlling spin-contamination}: a more detailed description of CUHF, with very interesting figures.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Guidance to the reader: What should the reader watch for in the paper? What are the interesting high points? What strategy did we use?
    \paragraph*{}
    In this paper we will discuss several modes in Hartree-Fock theory, focussed specifically on this symmetry. We will look at Restricted Closed
Shell HF, Unrestricted HF, Constrained Unrestricted HF and in a minor capacity at Restricted Open Shell HF. We will compare the energies
and wave functions and we will discuss using a symmetry argument why some energy might be higer than another. We will use 
Single excitation Configuration Interaction (CIS) to help in this analysis, as it will allow us to see multiplet excitation energies, 
which will indicate certain symmetries. If at all possible we will also attempt to visualise the orbitals obtained. 
    \item Summary/conclusion: What should the reader expect as conclusion? In advanced versions of the outline, you should also include all the sections that will go in the Experimental section (at the level of paragraph subheadings) and indicate what information will go in the Microfilm section.
    \paragraph*{}
    The CUHF wave function has the same symmetry we expect as the true wave function for restricted systems. It should give the same results as ROHF.
\end{itemize}

\section{Theory}

Optional section where you explain any theoretical constructs. In preliminary outline phases, this can be reduced to a set of essential equations.
\paragraph*{Concepts}
See notes on theory.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item RHF: The RHF wave function is not spin contaminated. This means that it is an eigenfunction of the $S^2$ operator, and it will follow the symmetry.
  \item UHF: The UHF wave function is spin contaminated. This means that it will not follow the correct symmetry.
  \item CUHF: The wave function is not spin contaminated.
  \item ROHF: the wave function is not spin contaminated.
  \item CIS
\end{enumerate}
\paragraph*{Equations to use}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item spin contamination general (1.6)
  \item spin contamination in NO basis (2.9) => DD (detailed dervation)
  \item expectation value over H for CIS (3.9) => DD
\end{enumerate}
\paragraph*{References}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Andrews et al. \textit{Spin contamination in single-determinant wavefunctions}
  \item Tsuchimochi and Scuseria \textit{Communication: ROHF theory made simple}: this describes CUHF theory
  \item Sherrill \textit{Derivation of the Configuration Interaction Singles (CIS) Method for Various Single Determinant References and Extensions to Include Selected Double Substitutions (XCIS)}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Methodology}

How were methods/descriptors implemented and characterized? Which systems are of interest for this hypothesis?
\paragraph*{}
The $H_3$ radical will be used as a model system. This is a small molecule that allows for easy interpretation and oversight.
\section{Results and discussion}

Central ideas: What were the results? Organize the outline and the paper around easily assimilated data - tables, equations, figures, schemes - rather than around text. Organize in order of importance, not in chronological order.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The $H_2$ stretch in different HF modes.
    \item The excited states in different HF modes
    \item Spin contamination in the excited states
\end{itemize}

In general, try to cover the major common points:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Method implementation
    \paragraph*{}
    For the code we used python with the help of the psi4 package.
    \item Method characterization
    \item System characterization
    \item Results
\end{itemize}
\paragraph*{Figures}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $H_2$ stretch in all modes => 1 figure per mode (spin contamination included)
    \item Excitation energies in all modes 
    \item orbitals?
\end{itemize}
\paragraph*{Schemes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item electron configurations for different modes (learn to draw them!!)
\end{itemize}
Remember to think of a paper as a collection of computational results, summarized as clearly and economically as possible in figures, tables, equations, and schemes. The text in the paper serves just to explain the data, and is secondary. The more information can be compressed into tables, equations, etc., the shorter and more readable the paper will be. If you do not yet have the relevant figures, use placeholders, such as in figure \ref{fig:my_label}.

\begin{center}

        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example-image}
        \caption{Interpretation of figures goes here. First focus on improving the readability of the figures, then on the captions.}
        \label{fig:my_label}
    \end{figure}
\end{center}

\section{Conclusions}

Central ideas: What does it all mean? What hypotheses were proved or disproved? What did I learn? Why does it make a difference?
